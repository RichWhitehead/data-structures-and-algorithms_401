# Reverse an Array

The first 401 Python code challenge. 

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

The first step was to white board the specific task that were given from canvas. Lee-Roy and I partnered for the white boarding portion and we then wrote our own code. I white boarded code challenge 01.

# Array Shift

This is the second 401 Python code challenge.

## Challenge 

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

# Array Binary Search

This is the third 401 Python code challenge.

## Challenge 

Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
