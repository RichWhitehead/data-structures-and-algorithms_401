# Breadth-first Traversal

## Author: Richard Whitehead

## Challenge 17

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

Approach & Efficiency
Time Big O(n) Space Big O(W) where W - Width of the tree because we are using Queue through traversing of our tree.
