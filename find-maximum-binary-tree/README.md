# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Author: Richard Whitehead

## Challenge

Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time Big O(n) Space Big O(W) where W - Width of the tree because we are using Queue through traversing of our tree
